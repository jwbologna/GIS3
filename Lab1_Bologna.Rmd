##Setup
Let's check the version of R we are running:
```{r}
version
```

Next, we'll load a few libraries:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
## Code examples
Generate a 20x20 matrix of random values:
```{r}
matrix <- raster(nrows = 20, ncols = 20, res = 1, xmn = 0, xmx = 20, ymn = 0, ymx = 20, vals = runif(400,0,10))
plot(matrix, axes = TRUE)
```

Plot points:
```{r}
p <- rbind(c(5,3), c(3,4.9), c(1.3,5.7), c(5,2.2), c(3.6,3), c(7.9,4.1))
plot(st_multipoint(p), axes=TRUE)
```

And that's R markdown!
